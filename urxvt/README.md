# urxvt

rxvt-unicode, commonly known as urxvt, is a color VT102 terminal
emulator for the X Window System. It was written by Marc Lehmann,
who forked it from rxvt in November 2003. Stability,
internationalization, the capability to display different fonts
and locales simultaneously and support for Unicode are its primary
focuses.
