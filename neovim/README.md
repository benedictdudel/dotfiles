# Neovim

Neovim is a refactor, and sometimes redactor, in the tradition of Vim
(which itself derives from Stevie). It is not a rewrite but a
continuation and extension of Vim. Many clones and derivatives exist;
some are very clever, but none are Vim. Neovim strives to be a
superset of Vim except for some intentionally-removed misfeatures.
It is built for users who want the good parts of Vim, and more.
