# Git

Git is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer
files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It
is primarily used for software development,[9] but it can be used to
keep track of changes in any files. As a distributed revision control
system it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for
distributed, non-linear workflows.
